          Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
          players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete
          with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4
          inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop a basket 18
          inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a
          backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team
          from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two
          points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth
          three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or
          designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three
          one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the
          game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an
          additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. Players advance the
          ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing
          it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On
          offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump
          shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler,
          intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may
          collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or
          backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without
          dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands
          then resume dribbling. The five players on each side fall into five
          playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the
          second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter
          but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players
          or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard,
          who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of
          offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally,
          players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. Invented
          in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in
          Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has
          evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed
          sports. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most
          significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of
          popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition. Outside North
          America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental
          championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions
          League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic
          Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport
          and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent
          hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and
          FIBA AmeriCup. The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's
          Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from
          continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA
          (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular),
          whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague
